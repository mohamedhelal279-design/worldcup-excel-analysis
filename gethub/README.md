# FIFA World Cup Matches Analysis (Excel Project)

**Last updated:** 2025-08-26

## ðŸ“– Project Description
This repository contains my Excel-based analysis of historical FIFA World Cup matches (1930â€“2014).
The goal is to explore trends in goals, attendance, stages, and team performance, using only Microsoft Excel
(Pivot Tables, Charts, Conditional Formatting).

## ðŸ”‘ Key Questions
- How has match attendance evolved over time?
- Do knockout stages differ in goal-scoring compared to group stages?
- Which teams and cities consistently host or deliver high-attendance matches?

## ðŸ—‚ Repository Structure
```
.
â”œâ”€ WorldCupMatches.xlsx           # Raw or cleaned dataset (add your file)
â”œâ”€ WorldCup_Analysis.xlsx         # Your Excel workbook with pivots & charts (add your file)
â””â”€ images/
   â”œâ”€ attendance_trend.png        # Paste screenshots of Excel charts here
   â””â”€ goals_by_stage.png
```

> then rightâ€‘click the picture â†’ **Save as Pictureâ€¦** â†’ PNG â†’ save into the `images/` folder.

## ðŸ“Š Sample Insights (replace with your own)
